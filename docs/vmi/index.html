	<h1>Virtual machine interfaces</h1>
	<p>Lobster abstracts virtual machine management to VM interfaces. These support various functions for operations like creating VMs, starting/stopping a server, and bandwidth accounting.</p>
	<p>Virtual machine interfaces are defined in lobster.cfg.json (if you are using a different configuration filename xyz.cfg, Lobster will look in xyz.cfg.json for the interface definitions). As the file extension implies, this uses a JSON file format; also, in addition to VM interfaces, it defines payment interfaces.</p>
	<p>The file looks something like this:</p>
	<pre>{
	"vm":
	[
		{
			"name": "Moon",
			"type": "openstack",
			"url": "http://controller:35357/v2.0",
			"username": "lobster",
			"password": "lobster123",
			"tenant": "Lobster",
			"network_id": "b169ba21-5ce1-4ff8-9cb5-0e12d3e1adb4"
		},
		{
			"name": "Mars",
			"type": "solusvm",
			"virt_type": "openvz",
			"node_group": "1",
			"url": "https://example.com:5656/api/admin/command.php",
			"api_id": "123",
			"api_key": "abcdef"
		}
	],
	"payment":
	[
		{
			"name": "Paypal",
			"type": "paypal",
			"business": "payments@example.com",
			"return_url": "https://example.com/"
		},
		{
			"name": "Bitcoin",
			"type": "coinbase",
			"callback_secret": "random",
			"api_key": "123",
			"api_secret": "abcdef"
		}
	]
}</pre>
	<p>Note that JSON is very strict; if you get errors about JSON formatting, make sure that you don't have trailing commas in the end of a dictionary or list block. If you still have errors, try a JSON validator like <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">jsonlint.com</a>.</p>
	<h3>Supported interfaces</h3>
	<p>Various VM management backends are supported via VM interfaces. Each has a different configuration method. In general Lobster tries to keep its services in one grouping in the backend (for example, a single user account or tenant).</p>
	<p>The pages below describe basic configuration of the interfaces (both on the backend and in lobster.cfg.json), and also related topics like how image identification works for the interface.</p>
