	<h3>Installation from binaries</h3>
	<p>Lobster binaries for Linux i686/amd64 are released in the <a href="https://github.com/LunaNode/lobster-release">lobster-release repository</a>. These are regularly built from the Lobster master branch (if a stable branch is added later on to lobster repository, lobster-release will include a corresponding branch).</p>
	<p>Do a git clone to grab the files, or click on the "Download ZIP" button on the right sidebar. Select the binary corresponding to your system and run it (make sure that when you run Lobster, the assets and tmpl directories are in your current working directory), e.g.:</p>
	<code>./lobster_x86_64 lobster.cfg</code>

	<h3>Installation from source</h3>
	<p>See INSTALL file for more information.</p>

	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	<p>Copy <tt>lobster.example.cfg</tt> to <tt>lobster.cfg</tt> and <tt>lobster.example.cfg.json</tt> to <tt>lobster.cfg.json</tt>. Both of these include configuration options that you will need to change.</p>
